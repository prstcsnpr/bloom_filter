/**
 * <p>
 * This class represents an implementation of a Bloom filter.
 * A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that can be used to test
 * for set membership in constant space and constant time.
 * It may return false positives, but never false negatives.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Descriptions of the algorithm can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter,
 * http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cao/papers/summary-cache/node8.html,
 * and http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362692&dl=ACM&coll=portal.
 * </p>
 *
 * Operations supported by the Bloom filter data structure are:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>item addition, either one by one or from a collection</li>
 * <li>checking item membership</li>
 * <li>union of two Bloom filters</li>
 * <li>intersection of two Bloom filters</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * All methods of the class check their arguments for validity.
 * NullPointerException and IllegalArgumentException are thrown if parameters are invalid.
 * BloomFilterSerializeException is thrown if the object couldn't be serialized or deserialized.
 * IncompatibleBloomFiltersException is thrown by unite and intersect method when trying to
 * operate with non compatible filters.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is mutable, so it is not thread-safe.
